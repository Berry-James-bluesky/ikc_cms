<p>Working with BlueSky feels like a real partnership rather than a transactional relationship. We're in this together and they have our backs every step of the way.</p>

<p>Amel oozes integrity and I felt very comfortable dealing with him from the start. I always felt confident the work was getting done in time frames agreed and the quality was always up there.</p>
<p>Working with BlueSky has always been a collaborative process where we bounce ideas around. They've suggested additional functionality and we know Amel's an extremely knowledgeable guy so we trust him to find the best solutions.</p>

<p>Amel and the team are creative, fair and flexible. We built a collaborative relationship with the intention to work with them long term.</p>
<p>The system was planned, delivered and executed on time and cost, which is pretty unusual when it comes to software development.</p>

						<div class="description">
<p>The guys were simply awesome to deal with, they were always upfront and transparent with a can-do approach.</p>
<p>When it came to pricing there were no nasty surprises and they always gave us options to 'develop now' or 'develop later' to manage our budget while still building in functionality.</p>
<p>Tim and Amel were always on our side, putting our business first and working as if they were part of our team.</p>

<p>We've been continually impressed with the team, any idea we throw at them they can scope, develop and deliver. Their talents have enabled us to demonstrate our USP to our clients and the technology they have developed has delivered increased business efficiencies.</p>
<p>Having worked with other web developers who are high on cost and low on delivery, Blue Sky are a breath of fresh air. They hit the mark when it comes to value for money and we have complete trust in their ability to continue to deliver innovative solutions for us.</p>
